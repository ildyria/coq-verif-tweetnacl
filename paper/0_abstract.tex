  We present a formalization of the X25519 key exchange protocol
  from Bernstein's 2006 paper, as standardized in RFC-7748.
  Based on this, we formally prove that the C implementation of
  this protocol in the TweetNaCl library is
  correct, and free from undefined behaviors like arithmetic overflows
  and array out of bound errors.
  We finally formally prove that X25519 is mathematically correct,
  in that it correctly computes multiplication in the elliptic curve 
  Curve25519.

  The proofs are all computer-verified using the Coq theorem prover.
  To establish the link between C and Coq we use the 
  Verified Software Toolchain (VST).
