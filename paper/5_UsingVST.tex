\section{Trust in the proof and VST}
\label{sec5-vst}

Any formal system relies on a trusted base. In this section we describe our
chain of trust bringing up to light some tripping points a user may encounter
when using VST.

\subsection{The Trusted Base}




\subsection{Time and Space Complexity}

Our work can be split into multiple parts. Bellow we provide an approximation of
the number of lines of codes and thus an idea of the size of the proofs required to
complete this work.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The proof that the Montgomery ladder over a generic field $\K$ respects
  the elliptic curve theory and then it's specialization for $\F{p^2}$.
  This represent 4218 lines of code for 0.75 man-year.
  \item The multiple level definitions of the ladder and operations over lists,
  their proof of correctness and soundness and additionally that the match with
  the generic Montgomery ladder. This count for 22967 lines of code for about 1.5 man-year.
  \item The proof that our specification matches the Clight translation with VST.
  This count for 6934 lines of code for about 0.75 man-year.
\end{itemize}
While the proof with VST took slightly less time, having to provide proof that every
intermediate computations slows down the process significantly. However it is
necessary in order to garantee our the absences of overflows and underflows.
