  We formally prove that the C implementation of
  the X25519 key-exchange protocol
  in the TweetNaCl library is correct.
  We prove both that it correctly implements the protocol from
  Bernstein's 2006 paper, as standardized in RFC~7748,
  as well as the absence of undefined behavior
  like arithmetic overflows
  and array out of bounds errors.
  We also formally prove, based on the work of Bartzia and Strub,
  that X25519 is mathematically correct, i.e.,
  that it correctly computes scalar multiplication on
  the elliptic curve Curve25519.

  The proofs are all computer-verified using the Coq theorem prover.
  To establish the link between C and Coq we use the
  Verified Software Toolchain (VST).
