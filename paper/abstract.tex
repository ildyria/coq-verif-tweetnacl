  In this paper we formally prove that the C implementation of
  X25519 key exchange in the TweetNaCl library matches
  the mathematical definition of X25519 from Bernstein's 2006 paper.
  The proof is computer-verified using the Coq theorem prover.
  To establish the link between C and Coq we use the 
  Verified Software Toolchain (VST).
