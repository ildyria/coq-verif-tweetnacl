\section{Using VST}

\subsection{The Trusted Base}

The soundness of our proof relies on a trusted base
, i.e. a foundation of specifications and implementations
that must stay correct with respect to the specifications.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Calculus of Inductive Construction} : The intuitionistic logic
  used by Coq must be consistent in order to trust the proofs. We assumed that
  the functional extensionality was also consistent with that logic.

$
\begin{array}{c}
  \forall A\ B (f\ g : A \to B ),\\
  ( \forall x : A , f(x) = g(x) ) \implies f = g
\end{array}
$
  \item \textbf{Specification, model...}

  \item The last part of the trusted base is about the \textbf{Coq kernel}, the
  \textbf{Ocaml compiler}, the \textbf{Ocaml Runtime} and the \textbf{CPU}.
  These are common to all proofs done with this architecture \cite{2015-Appel,coq-faq}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feelings of a VST user}

This approach is \textbf{slow}, \textbf{tedious} and \textbf{frustrating}.
The time cost way to big for such a proof and definitively not applicable for a
cryptographic engineer.

Necessity to prove everything at least 3 to 4 times.

Necessity to go back into your specification multiple times to refine your model.
e.g. prove \texttt{M(o,a,b)} later notice that you can have aliasing, need to redifine
your theorem to prove \texttt{M(o,a,a)} (\textit{squaring}) and other variants such as:
\texttt{M(a,a,b)} and \texttt{M(b,a,b)}.

Prove \texttt{M(o,a,b)} where o is a \texttt{list $\Z$} and then realize that
\texttt{o} can be a list of \textit{undefined}. Thus needs to reprove the above
theorem again.

The \texttt{forward} and \texttt{entailer} tactics are slow.

Specification and proofs does not need to be in the same file (as initially \textit{implied}
by the examples provided by the VST repository). Putting the specification of each
functions in separate file reduce the amount of dependencies. One does not need
to wait for the proof of \texttt{M(b,a,b)} to compile the proof of \texttt{crypto\_scalarmult(q,n,p)}.
This separation allows a high degree of parallelism during compilation \texttt{make -j},
greatly reducing the amount of time required.
