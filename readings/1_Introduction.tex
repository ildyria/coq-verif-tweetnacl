\section{Introduction}

Implementing cryptographic primitives without any bugs is hard. While tests
provides a decent code coverage, they don't cover 100\% of the possible values.

Using the \textit{clightgen} tool from compcert \cite{Leroy-backend}, we can
generate the \textit{semantic version} (Clight\cite{Blazy-Leroy-Clight-09}) of
the C code. Using the Floydâ€“Hoare logic\cite{1969-Hoare} with the Verifiable
Software Toolchain (VST)\cite{2012-Appel} we can show that the semantic of the
program is equivalent to some functions in Coq. We can then prove that these
\textit{equivalent functions} do respect the semantic of the arithmetic.
