\subsection*{Abstract}

By using the Coq formal proof assistant with the VST library, we first extend
the work of Bartzia and Strub \cite{DBLP:conf/itp/BartziaS14} to support
Montgomery curves. Then with the Verified Software Toolchain \cite{2012-Appel}
we then prove the soundness and correctness of TweetNaCl's Curve25519 implementation
up to the formal definitions of elliptic curves.
