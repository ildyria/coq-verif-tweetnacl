description:"""
Build dependency graphs between Coq objects, where Coq is the famous formal proof management system.

The graph can be interpreted like this :
edge n1 --> n2 : n1 uses n2
node :
green : proved lemma
orange : axiom/admitted lemma
dark pink : Definition, etc
light pink : Parameter, etc
violet : inductive,
blue : constructor,
multi-circled : not used (no predecessor in the graph)
yellow box : module
objects that are not in a yellow box are Coq objects.
