	Browser: the beginning of a port of the OCamlBrowser

This version of Browser is only compatible with OCaml 4.01.
For older versions of OCaml, use the sources from a previous
distribution of LablGTK (they shall be compatible with newer
versions of the library).

Installation:

* just type "make"

Use:

When you run browser, you just get a customized editor with lexical
coloring. Nothing very fancy.
In the file menu you can open a shell, running ocaml as subprocess.
