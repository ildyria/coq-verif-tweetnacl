HOW TO MAKE A RELEASE (WHEN YOU ARE ADMINISTRATOR).

1. Edit main/pcaml.ml and change version name. In general, it suffices
   to remove "-exp" (changing e.g. "7.09-exp" by just "7.09").
2. Do the same thing in file ocaml_src/main/pcaml.ml (cold source).
3. Edit file README.md, also update version number.
4. Commit and push in github.
5. Do a tag by typing "git tag relv" where "v" is the release number
   with only the digits (e.g. 709 if release is 7.09, resulting rel709).
6. Push tags by taping "git push --tags".
7. Check if present in github camlp5/camlp5 "release".

Then go to cloned directory camlp5.github.io and

1. Copy CHANGES from camlp5 into CHANGES.txt
2. Copy README.md from camlp5.
3. Edit file index.html, change the version number, the release date
   and the tar.gz link and name.
4. Commit and push. After some minutes, the home dir of camlp5
      https://camlp5.github.io/
   should be updated

AFTER THE RELEASE

1. Edit files main/pcaml.ml, ocaml_src/main/pcaml.ml and README.md to
   reflect new preparing version, changing, e.g. "7.09" into "7.10-exp"
   in these three files.
2. Edit CHANGES to add new title for new version, e.g.
      Camlp5 Version 7.10:
      --------------------
3. Commit and push.
